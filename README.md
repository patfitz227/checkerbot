A stock checking script which works for walmart newegg and gamestop. Curently I have the xbox series x individual consoles for all 3 sites and the packages with the xbox access for 34.99 a month listed on gamestop and the coming soon section of walmart. To add another website to the list just add a new dictionary entry with the website url, the div which you wish to search by, and the class name of that div.

**** currently just responds true if the selected div hasnt changed, will add a more active response aswell as a version meant to be run nonstop when time permits***
